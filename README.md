# NADS-Project
A script I made while interning at the National Advanced Driving Simulator

This script is built in Python. The main objective of this script is to make simulator car placement faster and easier, so you do not have to do it repetively. 

The Process 

First you need take the lri file with all these coordniates, roads, and overall data and seperate them my roads using their coordinates. Once you get that data you need to calulate the diffrent road lengths to see how long they are. Next I randomized the coordiates to place the car and it will tell you which road it will be placed on.
